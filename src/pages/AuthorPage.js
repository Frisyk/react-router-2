                <p className="blog-text">someone who does not have an IT background or major in computers or engineering, but is very interested in things related to IT, especially about web development. That's me, Frisyk. I started learning about web development during the semester break in 2022. Starting from the basics (HTML, CSS, and JS) to frameworks (tailwind, react) and others, I did it self-taught, both from reading articles on the internet and videos on YouTube. until now I still continue to learn and explore about this web development. My goal is to become a reliable and competent web developer, so that I can compete in the global industry in this ever-advancing era.</p> <br />
